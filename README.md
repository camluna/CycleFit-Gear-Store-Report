# CycleFit Gear Store Report

 About
 
 CycleFit Gear Store stands out as a prominent multinational company in the manufacturing and sale of bicycles sector, with an extensive presence in the commercial markets of North America, Europe, and Asia. With a workforce of 500 employees and strategically located regional sales teams, CycleFit has established its footprint as a leader in the bicycle industry, parts, and accessories. However, despite its prominent position, the company faces a lack of performance indicators that meet the demands of information necessary for effective decision-making. In this context, the objective of the project is to develop a comprehensive report in Power BI, providing detailed analysis and interactive visualizations on the company's sales performance, enabling end users to thoroughly understand the factors influencing sales, costs, and profitability, thus facilitating data-driven strategic decision-making.
